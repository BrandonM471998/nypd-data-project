Data source: [NYPD Historic Shooting Incident Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8)

# Introduction
This data set consisted of NYPD shooting incidents from 2006-2019, I limited the data to only include years 2015-2019 to get a cleaner picture of the data.
When going through the dataset I wanted to ask a question, are minors involved in more shootings than adults? Let's find out. For this project I used PowerBI

 The filters right below the 5.52k Incidents chart break out the occurences by borough, and then by year, which you can then use to filter the map

 1. Count of Victims by Gender: is a donut chart breaking out the count of victims by gender, showing that roughly 10% of all victims are male

 2. Occurences by Year, Latitude and Longitude: is a map of New York City with incident occurences broken out by year

 3. 5.52k Incidents: is a card showing the total occurences for all years combined

 5. Count of Incidents by Victim Age: is a stacked column chart showing the count of incidents by victim age, this lets you drill down to access the data for the count of      incidents by perpetrator age as well, showing that minors are not the top perpetrators

 7. Count of Incidents by Year: is a line chart showing the count of incidents by year, and what looks to be a decline in shooting incidents over the years 2015-2019
