# Introduction
This data set consisted of NYPD shooting incidents from 2006-2019, I limited the data to only include years 2015-2019 to get a cleaner picture of the data.
When going through the dataset I wanted to ask a question, are minors involved in more shootings than adults? Let's find out. For this project I used PowerBI
# Walkthrough
## 1. The first chart we see is a donut chart breaking out the count of victims by gender, showing that roughly 10% of all victims are male

## 2. The second chart is a map of New York City with incident occurences broken out by year

## 3. The third chart is a card showing the total occurences for all years combined

## 4. The filters right below the third chart break out the occurences by borough, and then by year, which you can then use to filter the map

## 5. The fourth chart is a stacked column chart showing the count of incidents by victim age

## 6. The fourth chart lets you drill down to access the data for the count of incidents by perpetrator age as well, showing that minors are not the top perpetrators

## 7. The fifth chart is a line chart showing the count of incidents by year, and what looks to be a decline in shooting incidents over the years 2015-2019
